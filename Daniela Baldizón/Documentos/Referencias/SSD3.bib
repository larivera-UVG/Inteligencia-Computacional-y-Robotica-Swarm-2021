	abstract = {This paper describes a novel, fast template- matching technique, referred to as bounded partial correlation (BPC), based on the normalised cross-correlation (NCC) func- tion. The technique consists in checking at each search posi- tion a suitable elimination condition relying on the evaluation of an upper-bound for the NCC function. The check allows for rapidly skipping the positions that cannot provide a better degree of match with respect to the current best-matching one. The upper-bounding function incorporates partial information from the actual cross-correlation function and can be calcu- lated very efficiently using a recursive scheme. We show also a simple improvement to the basic BPC formulation that pro- vides additional computational benefits and renders the tech- nique more robust with respect to the parameters choice.},
