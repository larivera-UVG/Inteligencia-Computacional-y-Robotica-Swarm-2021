	abstract = {High performance computing has become a key step to introduce computer tools, like real-time registration, in the medical ﬁeld. To achieve real-time processing, one usually simpliﬁes and adapts algorithms so that they become application and data speciﬁc. This involves designing and programming work for each application, and reduces the generality and robustness of the method. Our goal in this paper is to show that a general registration algorithm can be parallelized on an inexpensive and standard parallel architecture with a mall amount of additional programming work, thus keeping intact the algorithm performance.},
