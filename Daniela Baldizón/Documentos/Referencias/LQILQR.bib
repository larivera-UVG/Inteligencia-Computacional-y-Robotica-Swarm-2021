	abstract = {DC-DC converters are electronics elements which change voltage level based on switching.
Unlike linear circuit topologies, modeling and control of DC-DC converter circuits are fairly
difficult due to their switched structure. The main problems are to model semiconductor
switches, to identify various circuit structures and model the converter following an analysis
of the states. State-space model and system modeling are effectively used in converter
designs. The required transfer function is obtained thanks to a small signal analysis of the
system modeled using state-space model at a certain operating point. In optimal controlling
methods, the controller parameters based on the transfer function of the controlled system are
minimized using a known error criterion. Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller is one
of the most widely used optimal control methods. Linear Quadratic Integral (LQI) controller
is obtained by adding integral control to the LQR in order to increase the performance of
control system.},
